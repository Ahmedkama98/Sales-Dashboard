### Steps by Steps with Power BI

1. **Power Query – Data Extract, Transform & Load:** Power Query Editor in Power BI is a powerful tool for data cleaning and transformation. I use it to clean and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis. This may involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, merging datasets, or creating calculated columns.

2. **DAX:** To work with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) time intelligence functions and create tables and calculations.

3. **Create Data Model in Power BI Desktop:** Design and create a data model that represents the relationships between different tables in your data. Establish proper relationships, define keys, and establish hierarchies if needed. This step is crucial for accurate analysis and visualization.

4. **Develop Reports in Power BI Desktop:** Use the Power BI Desktop application to create reports based on your data model. Add visualizations such as charts, tables, and maps to represent the data effectively. Apply filters, slicers, and drill-through functionalities to allow users to interact with the data.
